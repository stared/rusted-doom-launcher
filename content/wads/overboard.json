  "description": "Doom guy has taken a holiday from hell, but it turns into the holiday from hell. This is 6 maps of island-hopping mayhem for Doom 2 (boom format, complevel 9). These maps are small but reasonably violent. Difficulty is average, but expect the usual mayhem. After the 6 maps there is a \"game over\" map, and beyond that lies \"new game plus\", which lets you play the same adventure again on a harder difficulty.",
