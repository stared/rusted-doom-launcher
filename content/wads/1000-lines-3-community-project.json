  "description": "A 32 map (with 2 bonus levels) megawad made for vanilla Doom 2, made by the community with a strict line limit of 1000 lines. Using the power of Votex, a vanilla version of the OTEX v1.1 texture pack by Ola Bj\u00c3\u00b6rling (ukiro). 1k3 also features a near totally original soundtrack by AD_79, Psyrus, Dragonfly and Tristan Clark. We also have 4 new monsters and a whole heap of new scenery, some of which was made just for 1k3.",
