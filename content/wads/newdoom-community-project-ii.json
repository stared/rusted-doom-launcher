  "description": "This project started on January 10, 2006. The first NDCP had been completed and released. Towards the end of that project talk had been going on about a sequel, and thus this project was formed. PumpkinSmasher took the reigns as project leader and started map sign-ups. The goal was not to take near as long as is took to finish the first NDCP. This goal was not achieved.",
