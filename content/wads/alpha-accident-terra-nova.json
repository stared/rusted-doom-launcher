  "description": "I always wanted to make something classic but with a new content. This wad has not only new maps, textures and music but also new things. Also there are new monsters (boss included), and a new (barely) map hazard - voltage... Maps in this episode are quite large and more of an andventure sort than anything else, but there's enough monsters to shoot at. I hope this will not end being a cliffhanger, because there are lot of things saved for later episodes which I'd like to implement.",
